# Mafia Engine Browser Extension

This is primarily made for MafiaScum, but is labeled Mafia Engine as that's my overarching project name for all mafia-related projects.

## Build Instructions

Make sure you have NodeJS installed as I use webpack to compile it properly

Run the following commands:

```
npm install
npm run build
```

It should create a `/dist` folder with the compiled extension. You can then load it into your browser.
